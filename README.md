# Neon RevOps — the open-source revenue operations layer for Claude

28 battle-tested Claude skills for B2B revenue teams. Drop them into any Claude project and get expert-level RevOps, GTM, ICP, positioning, deal velocity, and operating cadence thinking on demand.

**Built for:** B2B SaaS companies scaling from €5M to €150M+ ARR — where revenue operations is the constraint and hiring a full RevOps team isn't yet justified.

**What you get:**
- A diagnostics-first framework that finds the real constraint before recommending a fix
- Implementation playbooks for HubSpot, Salesforce, pipeline architecture, and compensation design
- ICP, positioning, and sales methodology skills that chain together into a complete GTM workflow

## How they work together

Skills chain naturally. Start with a diagnostic, then load the specialist.

- **Diagnose then fix:** `revops-diagnostic` finds the constraint → load the relevant specialist skill
- **ICP to pipeline:** `icp-builder` → `positioning-messaging-designer` → `sales-methodology`
- **Deal flow:** `deal-velocity-engineer` → `pipeline-visibility` → `revops-forecasting`
- **Partner motion:** `partner-ecosystem-architect` → `partner-channel-operations` → `revops-handoffs`
- **Operating rhythm:** `operating-cadence-designer` → `revenue-operating-cadence` → `revops-metrics`

## What's not here

These are the generic operational layer — the frameworks and methodology that any B2B revenue team can use.

The full delivery system (proprietary maturity model, diagnostic frameworks, and client-specific delivery skills used in live engagements) is used in private client work through [Neon Triforce](https://neontriforce.com). If your team needs implementation support rather than frameworks to self-serve, that's the conversation to have.

## When to hire us

These skills give you the thinking. They won't run a discovery call, facilitate a workshop, or hold your leadership team accountable to a new operating cadence. If you're hitting those limits — or if the diagnostic keeps surfacing the same constraint and nothing changes — [get in touch](https://neontriforce.com).
