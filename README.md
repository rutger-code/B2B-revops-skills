# RevOps Skills for Claude

28 purpose-built Claude skills for B2B revenue teams. Drop them into your Claude project to get RevOps, GTM, ICP, positioning, deal velocity, partner ecosystem, and operating cadence expertise on demand.

These skills encode the operational layer of a B2B revenue system — the frameworks, benchmarks, diagnostic patterns, and implementation playbooks that revenue operations teams use daily. Each skill is a standalone markdown file that loads methodology into your Claude session, giving you an expert co-pilot for specific RevOps challenges.

## Quick install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/NEON-Rutger/neon-revops-skills.git

# Copy individual skills into your Claude project
cp -r neon-revops-skills/revops-strategy/ your-project/.claude/skills/

# Or copy all skills at once
cp -r neon-revops-skills/*/ your-project/.claude/skills/
```

Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file (and optionally a `references/` directory with supporting data). Place the folder in your project's `.claude/skills/` directory. Claude discovers and loads skills automatically.

## How they work together

Skills chain naturally. Common workflows:

- **Diagnostic then fix:** `revops-diagnostic` identifies the constraint, then load the relevant specialist skill
- **ICP to positioning to sales:** `icp-builder` then `positioning-messaging-designer` then `sales-methodology`
- **Deal flow:** `deal-velocity-engineer` then `pipeline-visibility` then `revops-forecasting`
- **Partner:** `partner-ecosystem-architect` then `partner-channel-operations` then `revops-handoffs`
- **Cadence:** `operating-cadence-designer` then `revenue-operating-cadence` then `revops-metrics`

## What's not here

These are the generic operational layer — the frameworks and methodology that any B2B revenue team can use. The full delivery system (proprietary maturity model, diagnostic frameworks, and client-specific delivery skills) is used in private client engagements through [Neon Triforce](https://neontriforce.com).
