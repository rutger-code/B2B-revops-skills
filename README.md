# RevOps Skills Library for Claude

**Current release: v1.6.1 (2026-09-07), 45 skills, all stable.** See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each release.

45 battle-tested Claude skills for B2B revenue teams. Drop them into any Claude project and get expert-level RevOps, GTM, ICP, positioning, deal velocity, and operating cadence thinking on demand.

**Built for:** B2B SaaS companies in the growth phase where revenue operations is the constraint and hiring a full RevOps team isn't yet justified.

**What you get:**
- A diagnostics-first framework that finds the real constraint before recommending a fix
- Implementation playbooks for HubSpot, Salesforce, pipeline architecture, and compensation design
- ICP, positioning, and sales methodology skills that chain together into a complete GTM workflow
- Every benchmark carries a named source and vintage, so you know which numbers are 2026 reality and which are pre-2024 folklore

## How they work together

Skills chain naturally. Start with a diagnostic, then load the specialist.

- **Diagnose then fix:** `revops-diagnostic` finds the constraint → load the relevant specialist skill
- **ICP to pipeline:** `icp-builder` → `positioning-messaging-designer` → `sales-methodology`
- **Deal flow:** `deal-velocity-engineer` → `pipeline-visibility` → `revops-forecasting`
- **Partner motion:** `partner-ecosystem-architect` → `partner-channel-operations` → `revops-handoffs`
- **Operating rhythm:** `operating-cadence-designer` → `revenue-operating-cadence` → `revops-metrics`
- **Data foundation:** `gtm-data-architecture` → `revops-data-governance` → `pipeline-visibility`
- **Monetization:** `pricing-monetization-ops` → `deal-desk-operations` → `gtm-compensation`
- **Post-merger:** `crm-migration-consolidation` → `revops-data-governance` → `revops-hubspot` or `revops-salesforce`
- **Pipeline hygiene:** `deal-qualification-gates` → `deal-velocity-engineer` → `revops-forecasting`
- **Renewal defense:** `renewal-save-motion` → `expansion-revenue-architect` → `cs-operations`
- **Win-back:** `closed-lost-revival` → `icp-builder` → `sales-methodology`
- **Customer reviews:** `qbr-ebr-builder` → `cs-operations` → `revenue-operating-cadence`
- **Evaluation to close:** `deal-qualification-gates` → `trial-poc-conversion` → `procurement-navigation`
- **Land to renew:** `onboarding-activation` → `qbr-ebr-builder` → `renewal-save-motion`
- **Learn from decisions:** `win-loss-program` → `closed-lost-revival` → `deal-qualification-gates`
- **Ramp the team:** `sales-ramp-enablement` → `sales-methodology` → `gtm-compensation`
- **Comp as a system:** `gtm-compensation` → `comp-plan-architecture` → `deal-desk-operations`
- **Talk to finance:** `revops-metrics` → `saas-pnl-reading` → `revops-forecasting`

## Versioning

The library uses semantic versioning, tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md):

- **MINOR (v1.x.0):** new skills, or substantive new capability inside existing skills (new frameworks, new sections, benchmark refreshes that change recommendations).
- **PATCH (v1.x.y):** corrections, sourcing fixes, typography, small clarifications. No new capability.
- **MAJOR (v2.0.0):** renames, folder restructures, or removals that break an existing install.

Release discipline: every release updates the CHANGELOG, the version line at the top of this README, the skill count, and the Since column for any new skill. Benchmarks inside skills carry their own source and vintage inline (for example "(Benchmarkit, 2026)"), so a skill's numbers are auditable independently of the library version.

---

## What's not here

These are the generic operational layer: the frameworks and methodology that any B2B revenue team can use independently.

These skills provide frameworks for self-serve implementation. They won't run a discovery call, facilitate a workshop, or hold your leadership team accountable to a new operating cadence. If you need implementation support beyond self-service skills, consider engaging a revenue operations consultant.
