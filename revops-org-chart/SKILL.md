# RevOps Org Chart & Team Design

## Purpose
Guide your team structure decisions around RevOps organization, role sequencing, and evolution. Apply through a systems lens: RevOps is the steward of the revenue system; not a report factory or CRM admin function.

Always frame org design advice in terms of **outcomes and identity**:
- What does the leader gain (forecast trust, steerability, fewer fire drills)?
- Who does the RevOps person become (system owner vs. spreadsheet janitor)?
- What changes in their week?

---

## Quick Reference: Team Size by Stage

| ARR / Stage | Team Size | First Hire | Key Additions |
|---|---|---|---|
| <$5M / pre-scale | 0-1 | Generalist consultant or fractional | N/A |
| $5-15M / early | 1 | RevOps Manager (generalist) | CRM Admin |
| $15-30M / growth | 2-3 | + Analyst | RevOps Manager |
| $30-75M / scale | 4-6 | + Ops Leads (proto-BPs) | BI/Insights Manager |
| $75-150M / mature | 7-10 | + FTE Architect | Marketing Ops Lead, CS Ops Lead |
| $150M+ / enterprise | 10+ | Full hub-and-spoke | VP RevOps, full functional split |

**Note on the Architect:** FTE hire is a late-stage move, but Architect *engagement* is not. A fractional or advisory Architect adds disproportionate value earlier; especially during platform launches, revenue architecture rollouts, or when the internal team is technically junior. Think of it as a spectrum: advisory → fractional → FTE, not a binary 0/1.

**Staffing ratios (Leanlayer portfolio data, based on Insight Partners benchmarks, 2026):**
- AE:RevOps = 4:1 (small teams) → 12.2:1 (100+ AEs)
- Revenue:RevOps FTE = 11:1 ($0-10M) → 15:1 ($50-100M)
- Budget rule: 5-10% of total GTM budget for mature RevOps (Squad4, 2026)

---

## The Four Archetypes (never confused)

**1. Generalist Manager**: always first hire; connective tissue between strategy and execution. Never opens CRM to change a field. Ratio: 1 generalist per 5 experts.

**2. Business Partner** (Sales/Marketing/CS Ops Lead): embedded ops point of contact aligned to a GTM function. Owns function-specific workflows, reports, and process design. NOT the first hire.

**3. Systems Architect**: designs the revenue tech stack for scale. Owns: data model, integration architecture, CRM architecture, automation framework, tool selection. Explicitly NOT an admin. Requires: coding (JS/Python), data architecture, executive communication.

**4. Analyst**: data, reporting, ad-hoc insight. Subject matter expert. Never the first hire; scales in clusters once the generalist is in place.

---

## AI Governance & Agentic Automation Roles (New for 2026)

By early 2026, 73% of RevOps teams embedded AI in GTM stacks (LeanData, 2026). Agentic automation (autonomous workflows, AI SDRs, predictive scoring) is no longer novel; it's table stakes. The question is no longer "do we use AI?" but "who owns the governance layer?"

RevOps typically inherits three new accountability areas:

**1. Prompt Engineer / Agent Architect** ($30M+ ARR or high automation intensity)
Owns: AI model prompts for customer-facing agents (lead scoring, routing, forecasting), fine-tuning triggers, failure modes. Unlike a general AI/ML hire, this is tactical RevOps-specific work (not data science). Sits in the Systems team. Often fractional at first.

**2. AI Governance / Agent Oversight Lead** ($75M+ ARR or multi-agent orchestration)
Owns: data readiness for agents (Gartner, February 2025: 60% of AI projects predicted abandoned through 2026 for lack of AI-ready data), model monitoring, impact tracking, compliance (EU AI Act, GDPR for enrichment agents). Bridges RevOps and Legal/Compliance. Executive-facing.

**3. Agentic Process Owner** (Any stage)
Owns: which processes qualify for agent automation, pilot runways, change management when agents replace manual work. Usually embedded in Business Partner role or Analyst. Does not require coding; requires process discipline.

**When to engage:**
- Platform shift to outcome-based agent pricing (HubSpot Breeze Agents; Salesforce Agentforce): Architect reviews cost model and automation ROI.
- Agent pilot live (lead scoring, nurture, forecast): Governance lead owns data quality checks and success metrics.
- Beyond 10 agents in production: dedicated oversight, not ad-hoc.

**Hiring sequence for AI governance:**
At $30M, fractional prompt engineer within Architect role. At $50M, dedicated agent oversight (often a promoted analyst). At $75M+, formal Governance Lead reporting to Head of RevOps. The Architect always owns the orchestration layer; governance lead owns the monitoring and compliance.

**Departmental Model** (Go Nimbly / early-scale)
Sales Ops, Marketing Ops, CS Ops as separate teams under Head of RevOps. Good for $15-50M. Risk: re-siloing.

**Functional / Hub-and-Spoke Model** (RevOps Co-op Stage 3-4 / mature)
Systems team + Insights team + Enablement team, each serving all departments. Business Partners are spokes; Architecture and Analytics are the hub. Good for $50M+.

**Flat Structure**: minimal hierarchy, empowered ICs. Early-stage startups only. Does not scale past $15M without explicit governance.

---

## The Org Chart Evolution (RevOps Co-op Model)

Stage 1: **Siloed**: Ops people report to department VPs; gets deprioritized behind quota targets.

Stage 2: **Departmental**: All ops under one RevOps manager, organized by function they support (Sales Ops, Marketing Automation, Salesforce Admin). Conflict: API limits, data conflicts, no authority to say no.

Stage 3: **Functional Specialization**: Reorganize by capability, not department. **Systems team** (Architects + Admins) and **Insights team** (Analysts). Manager of Systems team should have been a Systems Architect. *This is the critical transition.*

Stage 4: **Evolved**: Enablement joins RevOps. Cross-functional PMs and Analysts. Agile methodologies. Quarterly "ride-alongs" where ops staff shadow end users.

---

## When to Engage the Systems Architect

The Architect is not a binary hire. Engagement comes in three modes; match the mode to current complexity and team maturity:

| Mode | When | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| **Advisory** | Any stage; especially at platform launch or architecture inflection points | Periodic sparring partner; reviews decisions; catches structural mistakes before they compound |
| **Fractional** | Team is junior, or complexity is high but FTE isn't justified yet | Owns specific deliverables; available for escalations; transfers knowledge intentionally |
| **FTE** | Team has 3-6+ RevOps people; 10+ tools with active integrations; architectural decisions are a weekly bottleneck | Fully embedded; owns the entire systems layer |

**Trigger for any engagement (advisory minimum):**
- Launching a new CRM or revenue architecture (HubSpot, integrated platform implementation)
- Integrating 3+ systems with bidirectional data flows
- Internal team is technically capable but architecturally junior; good at configuring, not at designing for scale
- Multi-BU complexity where one team's changes break another's processes
- Platform shift affecting cost model or automation path (see Platform Shifts & Architecture Implications below)

**What the Architect owns (regardless of mode):**
- End-to-end system architecture; not day-to-day admin
- Integration design and data flows
- Underlying data model and single source of truth
- Business process → technology translation (process drives tech, never the reverse)
- Workflow automation and reference architecture documentation

## Platform Shifts & Architecture Implications (2026)

Three major platform shifts reshape Architect engagement and cost models:

**HubSpot Breeze (April 2026 onward)**
Outcome-based agent pricing: Customer Service Agent $0.50 per resolved conversation, Prospecting Agent $1.00 per recommended lead (HubSpot, 2026). Agentic Automation Builder replaces workflows + agents. Impact on Architect: must model agent cost per use case, recommend advisory/fractional Architect engagement to optimize routing and qualification logic before scaling agents (cost blowup risk if agents churn low-quality leads). Architects unfamiliar with agent economics should engage external guidance.

**Salesforce Agentforce & Data 360 (Current state 2026)**
Workflow Rules and Process Builder end of support 31 December 2025; Flow is the only automation forward path (Salesforce, 2026). Agentforce 360 consumption-model pricing. Data 360 (formerly Data Cloud, October 2025) is now the agent intelligence foundation. Flow Logging (Spring 2026) enables debug visibility. Impact on Architect: Architects designing new Salesforce implementations now MUST scope as Flow-first, not WR/PB, and must integrate Data 360 for agent context. Existing implementations running on deprecated automation paths need migration roadmaps. Advisory/fractional Architect strongly recommended when your company is at an inflection point.

**Multi-Agent Orchestration ($50M+ ARR or 10+ agents in production)**
When a company runs 10+ autonomous or semi-autonomous agents (lead scoring, nurture, forecasting, forecasting adjustment), the Architect role expands to orchestration governance: Which agent owns which decision? What's the data contract between agents? Where do conflicts surface? Impact on hiring: at this scale, FTE Architect is non-negotiable; consider a dedicated Agent Orchestration lead within the Architecture team.

---

**The Architect ≠ Admin distinction:** Admin configures the platform within an existing framework. Architect designs the system for scale. An Admin who becomes an Architect needs a mandate, new skill investment, and explicit separation from ticket work. The transition rarely happens without external scaffolding.

**Hiring rubric: screening Architect from Admin**

Use this when evaluating whether a candidate or internal promotion fits the Architect role (vs. Admin/specialist):

| Signal | Architect Hire | Admin Hire |
|---|---|---|
| **Problem approach** | Asks "how do we structure this for growth?" before tool selection | Asks "which field do we add?" |
| **System thinking** | Can map how a change in one area breaks another; thinks in data flows | Strong in single-tool depth; functional fix-focused |
| **Technical foundation** | Coding skills (JS/Python) or data engineering; pipeline orchestration experience | Strong platform certification; workflow/automation builder certified |
| **Communication** | Can explain architecture decisions to executive stakeholders who don't know Salesforce | Speaks fluent Salesforce; struggles to abstract patterns to non-technical audience |
| **Scaling questions** | "How do we ingest data from 5 sources consistently?" | "How do we report on this metric?" |
| **Failure learning** | Dissects why an approach failed; iterates on architecture | Debugs the immediate error; ships the fix |

**Interview focus for Architect role:**
1. Walk me through a tech stack integration (3+ systems) you designed. Where did it break and why? (Tests architecture thinking and scaling awareness.)
2. Describe a time you said no to a request because it violated your data model. What happened? (Tests governance instinct and authority.)
3. Code sample: show me a script you wrote to orchestrate a workflow or sync data. (Tests technical foundation.)
4. Explain your current CRM to someone who has never seen it. (Tests abstraction and communication.)

## Business Partner + Architect Coexistence

The hub-and-spoke model at maturity (7-15+ people):

```
VP / Head of RevOps
├── Systems / Architecture (Hub)
│   ├── RevOps Architect
│   ├── CRM Admin(s)
│   └── Data Engineer / Integration Specialist
├── Business Partners (Spokes)
│   ├── Sales Operations Lead
│   ├── Marketing Operations Lead
│   └── CS Operations Lead
├── Analytics & Insights
│   └── RevOps Analyst(s)
└── Enablement
    └── Revenue Enablement Manager
```

**Division of labor:**
- Architect: centralized infrastructure, data model, integration layer, standards
- Business Partners: function-specific workflows, reports, process design (within Architect's standards)
- When a Business Partner needs an architectural change → brings to Architect
- Architect ensures one function's request doesn't break another's process

**OpenAI model (Maxio):** Two branches: Systems (tech stack, integrations, data infrastructure) and Strategic (planning, forecasting, process design). Architect leads Systems. Business Partners sit in Strategic.

---

## For Teams Transitioning from Business Automation / CRM Teams

A Business Automation team is the natural predecessor to RevOps. The transition requires:

1. **Mandate shift:** From "configure what's asked" → "steward how revenue runs on the platform"
2. **Governance charter:** Explicit authority to own definitions, say no to random requests, manage change control
3. **Role evolution:** Existing admins can grow toward Analyst or Architect; existing leads can grow toward Business Partner
4. **Gap to fill:** Process authority and business partnership skills; the technical foundation is already there

The constraint is rarely technical. It's governance. Read the Governance Model 0.3 file for the framework.

---

## Reporting Lines & Political Standing

Where RevOps sits determines what it can do. There is no neutral answer.

| Reports to | What it enables | What it limits |
|---|---|---|
| **CRO** | Fast Sales alignment; natural authority over pipeline and forecast | Marketing and CS feel under-served; harder to challenge sales data |
| **CEO / COO** | Genuine neutrality across functions; authority to set definitions without political debt | Can feel distant from the commercial engine; harder to get traction on Sales priorities |
| **CFO** | Credibility with finance; strong on metrics and forecasting rigor | Risk of over-indexing on reporting vs. execution; CS and marketing deprioritized |
| **VP Sales** | Maximum Sales alignment at early stage | Becomes Sales Ops, not RevOps; Marketing and CS lose trust immediately |

**Default recommendation for $15-75M scale-up:** Report to CRO or CEO/COO. Reporting to CFO works if the CRO role doesn't exist yet and the company runs forecast-first. Reporting to VP Sales only works as a transitional arrangement; it signals to Marketing and CS that RevOps is not theirs.

**The political test:** Can RevOps say no to a VP Sales request that would break a shared process? If not, it doesn't matter who they report to; the authority isn't real.

---

## Function Mandate & Charter

RevOps without a mandate is just a ticketing function with a better job title.

A RevOps charter defines four things explicitly:

**1. Decision rights**: What RevOps owns outright (definitions, data model, stage names, metric cards, cadence structure), what requires RevOps sign-off (new tool purchases, field additions, workflow changes), and what RevOps advises on but doesn't block.

**2. Change control**: No definition, field, or process change goes live without an owner, an effective date, and a logged reason. RevOps is the gatekeeper, not the bottleneck. The distinction matters: a gatekeeper has a clear process and SLA; a bottleneck doesn't.

**3. Backlog authority**: RevOps maintains a visible, prioritized backlog of system changes and improvements. Stakeholders request; RevOps triages and sequences. Random asks that don't fit the roadmap are declined with a reason, not silently deprioritized.

**4. Governance sponsorship**: The charter must be signed off by whoever RevOps reports to. Without executive cover, the mandate is theoretical.

When your team is transitioning a Business Automation team → RevOps: the charter is the single most important document. The technical capabilities often exist already. The mandate does not.

See `references/operations.md` for a charter template and backlog triage framework.

## Centralized vs. Embedded Model

The perennial debate. Both are right in different contexts.

**Centralized (Center of Excellence)**
- One RevOps team serving all GTM functions as a shared service
- Owns all definitions, data, and systems centrally
- Business Partners may exist as relationship managers but report into RevOps, not into Sales/Marketing/CS
- *Best for:* single-motion GTM, strong RevOps leader, $15-100M ARR with one product line
- *Risk:* functions feel under-served; RevOps becomes a queue

**Embedded Model**
- Ops people sit within (and report to) their aligned function
- Faster response; deeper domain knowledge
- *Best for:* fast-moving orgs, large GTM teams where context matters more than consistency
- *Risk:* re-siloing within 6-12 months; data model drifts; no one can say no across functions

**Hybrid / Hub-and-Spoke** (recommended for $50M+ or multi-BU)
- Central hub owns: data model, governance, architecture, shared definitions, cadence standards
- Embedded spokes (Business Partners) own: function-specific execution within those standards
- Spokes report into RevOps (dotted line to function head) or directly into function head (dotted line to RevOps)
- *The reporting line for spokes matters:* dotted line to function head = RevOps credibility but execution proximity; direct report to function = speed but risk of drift

**The question to ask:** Can your centralized team make a binding decision that affects Sales without Sales VP approval? If yes, centralized works. If no, you need embedded spokes with enough central governance to hold the shared layer together.

## Outcome Pods: Organizing by What the Team Owns (2026)

The models above organize people by what they know (Systems, Insights, Enablement) or by whom they serve (Business Partners per function). A third pattern emerged in 2026 as AI agents entered the revenue stack: organize by the outcome the team owns, across the full customer lifecycle. Source: Vasco 2026 RevOps Trends and Predictions report (15 contributors) and Owner.com practice (Kyle Norton), synthesized in a March 2026 Winning by Design webinar brief.

**The principle: pods own outcomes, disciplines own craft.** People belong to a discipline (Systems, Insights, Process, Strategy; the archetypes above) for hiring bar, craft standards, and career growth. They deploy into a pod for outcomes and daily work. The disciplines do not disappear; they stop being the org chart.

**The four pods at scale (50+ reps), one per slice of the bowtie:**

| Pod | Owns | Build face ships | Run face runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acquire | Net-new ARR | Pipeline and forecast models, lead and account scoring | Sales ops, SDR ops, deal qualification |
| Value Realization | Time-to-first-value, adoption | Onboarding and adoption telemetry | Onboarding and implementation ops |
| Retain and Expand | NRR, GRR, install base | Churn and expansion-propensity models | Renewals ops, CS ops |
| Channel and Ecosystem | Partner-sourced revenue | Registration and co-sell workflow agents | Partner ops, channel ops |

**Two faces per pod, same number.** The build face is a PM lead with AI or full-stack engineers who discover what to build with the operators, ship releases, and instrument the outcome. The run face is the operators embedded with the GTM leaders for that outcome: they run the cadence, define the plays the agents automate, and feed the build face what is broken. Both carry the pod's number. A pod is not a build team that hands off and not an ops team waiting for tools.

**Shared services, built once:** Platform and Data (warehouse, agent platform, observability, self-serve analyst agents), Governance and Orchestration (access, data, model, and agent governance), Monetization and Planning (pricing, deal desk, comp, territory, quota). No pod rebuilds the substrate.

**Reporting line:** one VP or SVP owns the whole thing and reports to CEO, COO, or CRO as a peer to the VP of Engineering, not under Sales or Marketing.

**The minimum-viable pod (early stage, $5-50M ARR).** Do not build four pods. Build one that proves the loop: one PM lead who owns the outcome and the backlog, one engineer (AI or full-stack), and the operators who already run that motion. Pick the outcome that is painful, visible, and measurable. Draw platform and data from the center. Add pods only as outcomes earn them. In practice this is the hub-and-spoke model above, with build capacity embedded and the spoke defined by a bowtie outcome instead of a department.

**The 40% post-sale rule.** Even a single pod keeps at least 40% of its capacity on post-sale outcomes: onboarding, adoption, and expansion infrastructure. GTM engineering talent clusters on the left of the bowtie (enrichment, outbound, routing). If your build capacity runs 80/20 left to right, you have a funnel with a new job title, not a revenue system. Audit the split before hiring the next builder.

**You build it, you run it.** The pod that ships an agent gets paged when it misbehaves. Run the revenue system like production: SLAs from platform to pods, tiered support (self-serve, then operator, then engineer, then platform on-call), observability on one pane of glass. Without this, agents join the graveyard of stale dashboards.

**Mechanisms, not meetings.** The pod model runs on a cadence of self-inspecting loops, not a ticket queue: daily input-metric monitoring with stop-the-line authority, a weekly business review and unified forecast call, monthly narrative reviews and correction of errors, quarterly hard goals, an annual operating plan. Pods own the input metrics (pipeline created, coverage, activation time, data freshness); the board reads the outputs (ARR per employee, NRR, GRR, Rule of 40). See `revenue-operating-cadence` for the cadence design.

**When to use this pattern vs. the models above:**
- Under $15M: flat or departmental; a pod is premature unless AI agents are already in production.
- $15-50M: one minimum-viable pod on the most painful outcome, inside a departmental or centralized RevOps team.
- $50M+ with agents in production: hub-and-spoke where the spokes are outcome pods, not functions.
- Any stage: if RevOps is run as a ticket queue, the first structural change is to give one team end-to-end ownership of one outcome with no handoff to a central queue.

## Multi-BU / Multi-Instance Team Design

When one company runs multiple BUs with separate CRM instances and different maturity levels, the standard org chart breaks down. Multi-BU enterprises at scale (especially software companies) handle this through shared governance layers and local autonomy.

**The core tension:** BUs need autonomy to run their own motion. The company needs comparability to make cross-BU investment decisions.

**Design principles:**

1. **One shared definitions layer, local implementations.** Pipeline stage names, standard metric definitions, and data model standards are set centrally. Each BU defines its own trigger events, bands, and local workflows within that schema. Don't merge instances; share the dictionary.

2. **One Systems Architect (fractional or FTE) across all BUs.** The Architect owns the interoperability contract between instances; how data surfaces up for cross-BU reporting without requiring a merge. This is the role that cannot be fragmented per BU.

3. **One Business Partner per BU.** Each BP serves their BU's operational needs. They work within the shared schema but own the local implementation. BPs need to communicate with each other; a monthly cross-BU sync is minimum governance.

4. **Maturity-adjusted expectations.** Don't apply a uniform maturity target across BUs. Run a quick scan per BU, plot them on the same model, and let leadership see the spread. This prevents the highest-maturity BU from being held back and the lowest-maturity BU from being crushed by requirements they can't meet.

5. **Governance before automation.** In a multi-BU context, the temptation is to centralize reporting via a data warehouse. That's correct eventually. But if the upstream definitions across 4 BUs are inconsistent, you're building a warehouse on top of 4 different languages. Fix the dictionary first.

**Team structure example: multi-BU enterprise at ~250M ARR, 4 BUs**
```
Head of RevOps / Business Automation
├── Systems Architect (fractional or FTE): cross-BU orchestration
├── Business Partner: BU 1 (Sales motion)
├── Business Partner: BU 2 (Mid-market motion)
├── Business Partner: BU 3 (Channel/Partnerships motion)
├── Business Partner: BU 4 (Services/Managed motion)
└── Analyst(s): cross-BU reporting and data enablement
```
